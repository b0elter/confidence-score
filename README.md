# confidence-score
Do you need an acurate description of how certain you are of data you are returning?  This project may be able to help.  Here at Confidence Score®™, we pride ourselves on telling you exactly how confident you are.  You give us all of the information you can about your data, and we will give you a result based on how confident we are on how confident you are.

The current iteration is a simple script that will give you a number between 0 (inclusve) and `max` (exclusive) and format it based on your `strfmt` command.

Future implementation ideas include:
* Simple REST API
* More data inputs!
* More complex calculations including input from weather, coordinates, political candidates, trending twitter hashtags, and more!
